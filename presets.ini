# Betting Strategy Presets
# ========================
# Configuration presets for the carry_over_index_delta bridging policy.
#
# Parameters:
#   bridging_policy      - Bridging strategy when losing at top of ladder
#   recovery_target_pct  - Percentage of loss to recover before resetting (0.0-1.0)
#   crossover_offset     - Starting index in next ladder when bridging
#
# Usage:
#   python simulator.py --config presets.ini --preset aggressive

[DEFAULT]
# Default balanced configuration
bridging_policy = carry_over_index_delta
recovery_target_pct = 0.5
crossover_offset = 0

[aggressive]
# Higher recovery target, start higher in next ladder
# Risk: May need larger bankroll to sustain losses
# Reward: Recovers more losses before resetting
recovery_target_pct = 0.75
crossover_offset = 2

[conservative]
# Lower recovery target, start at bottom of next ladder
# Risk: Resets more frequently, slower profit accumulation
# Reward: Lower variance, more predictable outcomes
recovery_target_pct = 0.25
crossover_offset = 0

[moderate]
# Balanced approach with slight offset
# Good middle ground between aggressive and conservative
recovery_target_pct = 0.5
crossover_offset = 1

[full_recovery]
# Must recover all losses before resetting (back to breakeven)
# Risk: Extended recovery periods possible
# Reward: Never reset at a loss
recovery_target_pct = 1.0
crossover_offset = 0

[quick_reset]
# Minimal recovery target, reset quickly
# Good for high-frequency trading style
recovery_target_pct = 0.1
crossover_offset = 0

[high_offset]
# Standard recovery but start mid-ladder
# Useful when lower stakes in next ladder are too small
recovery_target_pct = 0.5
crossover_offset = 3
